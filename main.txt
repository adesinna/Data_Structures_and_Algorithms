Algorithm is a set of steps a program takes to finish a task

There are many problems in computer science, there are many solutions. However,
the field of algorithm gives the best solution to the problem.

Algorithm

1. Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output

2. The step in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order

3. The steps also need to be distinct

4. The algorithm should produce a result

5. It should complete in a finite amount of time


Time Complexity is a measure of how long it takes the algorithm to run.

Space Complexity is measure of the memory the algorithm needs to run.

Big O, O(n) is the theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size

O(1) constant time operation, this is when the number of steps is always constant no matter the value

O(log n), this is the logarithmic runtime

O(n2) the number of runtime is always the square of n, this is a quadratic runtime

O(n log n) this is runtime of nlogn number of operations







1.Linear Search
   -Algorithm
     - Iterate through each element in the list/array.
     - Compare the current element with the target element.
     - If the element is found, return its index; otherwise, continue to the next element.
     - If the end of the list is reached and the element is not found, return a special value (e.g., -1).

   -Time Complexity
     - O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the list.
     - Linear search goes through each element one by one until the target is found or the end of the list is reached.

   -Use Case
     - Linear search is suitable for small lists or when the elements are not sorted.


2.Binary Search
   -Algorithm
     - The array must be sorted for binary search to work.
     - Compare the target element with the middle element of the array.
     - If they are equal, the search is successful, and the index is returned.
     - If the target is less than the middle element, search in the left half of the array; otherwise, search in the right half.
     - Repeat the process on the chosen half until the element is found or the search space is empty.

   -Time Complexity
     - O(log n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the list.
     - Binary search efficiently halves the search space with each comparison.

   -Use Case
     - Binary search is efficient for large sorted lists.



In summary, linear search is a simple algorithm that works on unsorted lists, while binary search is more efficient but
requires a sorted list.



Data Structure

This is a data storage format, it is the collection of values and the format they are stores in.

The relationship between the values in the collection as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure.
