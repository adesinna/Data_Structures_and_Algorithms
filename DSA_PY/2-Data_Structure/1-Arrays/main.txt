 ðŸ§  What is an Array?

An array is a collection of elements stored in a fixed order. Each element can be accessed by its index (position).

Think of it like a row of boxes:


Index:    0    1    2    3
Values: [10,  20,  30,  40]




Arrays in Python

Python doesnâ€™t have a built-in `array` like C or Java, but you can use:

1. List (most common in Python)

* Works like an array.
* Can hold numbers, strings, or anything.
* Very flexible.

# Creating a list (array)
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]

# Access elements
print(arr[0])  # Output: 10

# Change element
arr[1] = 25

# Add element
arr.append(50)

# Remove element
arr.pop()  # removes last element


They help you:

* Store data
* Access it quickly
* Perform operations efficiently


Python lists are dynamic arrays that grow automatically using over-allocation. You can append or remove elements efficiently.
In contrast, NumPy arrays are staticâ€”their size is fixed after creation.
Resizing a NumPy array creates a new array. NumPy prioritizes speed and memory efficiency over flexibility.
