Dictionaries are key value pairs, they make use of hash function to store they in memory, unlike list you do not
need to know its index to get a value, just with the key you can get the value.

Hash function, converts the key:value into  a collection in memory space.

To lookup, delete, insert and search, they have O(1) time complexity and space complexity of O(n)

A hash collision occurs when two different keys in a hash table (like a Python dictionary) produce the same hash value,
meaning they would map to the same index in the underlying array.
