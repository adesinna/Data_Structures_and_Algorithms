What is a linked list ? It contains a set of nodes, each node contains two elements, one the data and a pointer to the
next node. The first element is called the head of the list and the last element is the tail which has a pointer to
null.

Why linked list ?
Unlike dictionaries, where they are not ordered, in linked list they are ordered.

To put it in the beginning of the linked list, O(1)

To append to the inked list, O(n)

To search is O(n)

To insert is O(n)

To delete is O(n)
