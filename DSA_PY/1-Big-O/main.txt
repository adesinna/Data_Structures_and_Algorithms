Big O notation describes how long an algorithm run, just how does it perform when the set goes larger. That is how many
operations is needed as the number of elements increases.

1. Linear Time
    When it takes n number of operations for n number of elements, we say it has a linear time, denoted O(n)

2. Constant Time
    When it takes exactly same number of operations no matter the size of the element, this is called constant time
    O(1) # note since py get the length from memory storage it is also a constant time, also accessing an element too

3. Quadratic Time
    This is when it takes n square number of operations for n numbers of elements
