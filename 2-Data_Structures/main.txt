A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

It defines a set of operations that can be performed on the data, as well as the relationships and rules governing
those operations. Data structures are fundamental to computer science and play a crucial role in designing
and implementing algorithms.
